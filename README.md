## A little bit about me 🔮

Hey! I'm Semiha, a [`42 school`](https://42.fr/) student in Paris. I am currently looking for a job or internship in data science and machine learning.

To achieve that, I am currently learning `Python` with a focus on **data science** and **linear regression**.

I am also interested in **embedded systems** and looking to dive into it more in the near future.

My background is in **arts** and **design thinking**. I have a bachelor's degree in **fashion design** and a master's degree in **fashion art direction**. I have worked as a **designer** and **communications manager** for 5 years before deciding to change my career path.

Feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/semiha-beyazkilic/) if you have any questions or just want to chat! 💜

## My values 🌟

🌱 Beginner's mindset and curiosity

🏹 Perfection is a goal, not the end result

📝 Listen to others and be open to feedback

## How I work 💻

I am a very organized person and I like to plan ahead. I like to have a clear idea of what I am doing and where I am going. I am aware that this can both be a strength and a weakness depending on the context. I am very good at planning and organizing projects but I can also get stuck in the planning phase and not get anything done.

I am improving along every project and I am learning to find the right balance. One way is to break down my projects into smaller tasks and to set deadlines for each task. Another is to simpy start writing code and see where it takes me.

I am also very curious and I like to hear about new ideas, and see problems through many angles. This comes from my background in design thinking and a keen interest in sociology.

I am a very visual person and I like to have a clear visual representation of my work. I like to use `Trello` to organize my tasks and I like to use `Figma` to create mockups and wireframes.

## School projects 🎒

Below are my school projects. `42 school` [common core projects]((https://42.fr/en/the-program/innovative-learning/)) are mostly C, C++ and Shell. I came accross other languages along the way like SQL, PHP, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Typescript.

I enjoyed working on these projects a lot, I loved learning about low level programming and I have a special place in my heart for C. I also enjoyed learning about web development, but I think data science and machine learning is more my scene. I am also passionate about embedded systems and robotics.

The projects I am most proud of, because of their complexity and the amount of work I put into them, and the amount of knowledge I gained from them, are:

- `push_swap` is a sorting algorithm in C. It is a very efficient algorithm that can sort a list of up to 500 numbers in less than 5500 operations.
- `webserv` is a HTTP/1.1 server in C++98 that I made with an other student. It is a fully functional web server that can handle multiple clients at the same time.
- `ft_transcendence` is a web application that I made with 4 other students. It is a multiplayer pong game complete with a chat and a ranking system.
