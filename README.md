### `$ man about > ~/github/semx2a`

Hey! I'm Semiha. I'm a Software Engineer and [`42 Paris`](https://42.fr/) alumni.

I previously worked at [nao Labs](https://getnao.io) as a Full Stack Software Engineer where I helped develop a vscode fork for data practitionners. Our team was small (3 tech/eng 1 data) at the time so I was lucky to fiddle with the whole stack. 

At nao Labs, I helped build an AI-powered IDE using **React**, **Typescript**, and **Node.js** for the frontend. The backend was powered by **Python** and **Django**, serving both the website and API endpoints. The core feature was an **AI Agent** that integrates with users' databases and workspaces to assist with data tasks. I contributed to the agent's development using OpenAI's Python API and helped streamline our CI/CD pipeline.

I am currently working at 8849 Studio in Paris, helping them build a VFX pipeline based on [Ynput's](https://ynput.io/) AYON Pipeline Platform.
