### `$ man about > ~/github/semx2a`

Hey! I'm Semiha. I'm a Software Engineer and [`42 Paris`](https://42.fr/) alumni.

I previously worked at [nao Labs](https://getnao.io) as a Full Stack Software Engineer where I helped develop a vscode fork for data practitionners. Our team was small (3 tech/eng 1 data) at the time so I was lucky to fiddle with the whole stack. 

At nao Labs, I helped build an AI-powered IDE using **React**, **Typescript**, and **Node.js** for the frontend. The backend was powered by **Python** and **Django**, serving both the website and API endpoints. The core feature was an **AI Agent** that integrates with users' databases and workspaces to assist with data tasks. I contributed to the agent's development using OpenAI's Python API and helped streamline our CI/CD pipeline.

Overall I learned a lot about web development, software architecture, AI and how to work in a small team.

I am now looking for a new opportunity to work on exciting projects, preferably in the fields of web development, AI, embedded systems or robotics. I am open to remote work and I am also interested in working with startups.

Feel free to peruse through my public repos. They're mostly made of 42 school projects in C, C++, Python, and some web development projects in React, Node.js, and Typescript. I also have a few personal projects that I worked on in my free time.
