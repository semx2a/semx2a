## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Semiha, a 42 student in Paris. I am currently looking for a job or internship in data science and machine learning. To achieve that, I am currently learning Python with a focus on data science and linear regression.

I am also interested in embedded systems and looking to dive more into it in the near future. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or just want to chat! ðŸ’œ
