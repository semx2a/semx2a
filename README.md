## A little bit about me üîÆ

Hey! I'm Semiha, a [`42 Paris`](https://42.fr/) student. I am currently looking for a job or internship in software engineering.

Feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/semiha-beyazkilic/) if you have any questions or just want to chat! üíú

## School projects üéí

Below are my school projects. `42 school` [common core projects]((https://42.fr/en/the-program/innovative-learning/)) are mostly C, C++ and Shell. I came accross other languages along the way like SQL, PHP, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Typescript.

I enjoyed working on these projects a lot, I loved learning about low level programming and I have a special place in my heart for C. I also enjoyed learning about web development, but I think data science and machine learning is more my scene. I am also passionate about embedded systems and robotics.

The projects I am most proud of, because of their complexity and the amount of work I put into them, and the amount of knowledge I gained from them, are:

- `push_swap` is a sorting algorithm in C. It is a very efficient algorithm that can sort a list of up to 500 numbers in less than 5500 operations.
- `webserv` is a HTTP/1.1 server in C++98 that I made with an other student. It is a fully functional web server that can handle multiple clients at the same time.
- `ft_transcendence` is a web application that I made with 4 other students. It is a multiplayer pong game complete with a chat and a ranking system.
